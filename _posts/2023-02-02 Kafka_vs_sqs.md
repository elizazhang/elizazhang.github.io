Why do we choose Kafka over sqs queue 

Kafka and SQS (Simple Queue Service) are both messaging systems, but they have different design goals and are suited for different use cases. Some of the factors that might influence the choice between the two include:

Performance: Kafka is designed to handle high-volume, high-throughput data streams, whereas SQS is optimized for lower-volume, async messaging.

Durability: Kafka provides a highly durable messaging system, with options to tune the level of durability to meet the specific needs of the application. SQS is also durable, but it provides less control over the durability guarantees.

Processing model: Kafka provides a publish/subscribe model, where messages are organized into topics, and consumers subscribe to specific topics. SQS provides a simple queue-based model, where messages are delivered to a single consumer.

Ordering: Kafka provides strict ordering guarantees for messages within a partition. In SQS, messages may be delivered out of order.

Latency: Kafka provides low latency, near-real-time processing. SQS has a higher latency, with a delivery time of at most 60 seconds.

Scalability: Both Kafka and SQS are scalable, but the specifics of their scalability differ. Kafka provides a distributed, partitioned, and replicated architecture that can scale horizontally. SQS provides a managed service that automatically scales with the number of messages.

In summary, the choice between Kafka and SQS will depend on the specific requirements of the application, including the volume, velocity, and type of data, as well as the desired processing model and level of durability.
