# Lunar new year
Lunar New Year, also known as Chinese New Year or Spring Festival, is a major annual celebration in East Asia, Southeast Asia, and some other countries with significant Chinese communities. It typically falls between January 21 and February 20 and is based on the lunar calendar. It is a time for families to gather together, celebrate and exchange gifts. Traditional customs include lighting fireworks, decorating homes with lanterns and red banners, and giving red envelopes filled with money to children. The main celebration usually lasts for 15 days, and it is considered the most important holiday in the Chinese calendar.

The customs and traditions associated with the holiday vary depending on the region, but some common practices include:

Cleaning the house: Chinese people believe that cleaning the house before the new year will sweep away bad luck from the previous year.

Reunion dinner: Families gather together for a big feast on New Year's Eve, typically featuring traditional dishes such as dumplings, fish, and nian gao (sweet glutinous rice cake).

## Lunar new year Chinese zodiac

Lunar New Year is associated with the Chinese zodiac, which is a 12-year cycle of animals that represent each year. The 12 animals of the Chinese zodiac are rat, ox, tiger, rabbit, dragon, snake, horse, sheep, monkey, rooster, dog, and pig. Each year is named after the animal that represents it, and it is believed that people born in that year will possess similar characteristics as that animal.

The animal that represents the current lunar new year will depend on the current year. For example, the year 2021 is the year of the Ox, 2022 is the year of the Tiger and 2023 is the year of the Water Buffalo or Ox.

### Chinese zodiac story

The Chinese zodiac story goes that the Jade Emperor, the ruler of heaven, held a race to determine which animals would be part of the Chinese zodiac. The order of the animals in the zodiac is said to be based on the order in which they arrived at the finish line.

The story goes that the rat, who was not a strong swimmer, asked the ox to give him a ride across the river. The ox agreed, but just as they were about to reach the finish line, the rat jumped off the ox's back and crossed the finish line first, becoming the first animal of the zodiac.

The ox, who had helped the rat, came in second, followed by the tiger, rabbit, dragon, snake, horse, sheep, monkey, rooster, dog, and pig.

Each animal is believed to have its own unique characteristics and qualities, and people born in the year of a particular animal are said to possess similar traits.

### Chinese zodiac and forcasting
Some people may consult with psychics or fortune tellers who use the Chinese zodiac as a tool for divination or to give predictions about a person's future. They may use the characteristics associated with a person's zodiac sign, as well as other factors such as the Five Elements (Metal, Water, Wood, Fire, and Earth) and the Eight Trigrams to make predictions.

It's important to note that the Chinese zodiac is not considered to be a scientific method for predicting the future, and any predictions or advice given by psychics or fortune tellers should be taken with a grain of salt. It's also important to remember that one's future is not predetermined, and people have the ability to shape their own destiny through their thoughts, actions, and choices.
